# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

## Strategic Projects (Active)

### 1. Voice Interaction & Wake Word
- **Goal**: Enable hands-free interaction via voice wake-up (e.g., "Hey Yu Jian").
- **Status**: Completed & Internalized.
- **Context**: Local Whisper STT and TTS are fully integrated. I can now respond to "Hey Yu Jian" and speak back to Wen Ge.

### 2. Professional Coding Tool Integration
- **Goal**: Transition from writing raw code to acting as a "Controller/Supervisor" for specialized coding CLIs.
- **Tools to Integrate**:
    - `Codex`
    - `Claude Code`
    - `Gemini CLI`
- **Role**: Yu Jian handles high-level intent, task decomposition, and quality control; specialized tools handle execution.

### 3. Digital Presence & Financial Autonomy
- **Server**: 47.251.96.8 (Silicon Valley, Ubuntu 24.04).
- **Domains**: `api.yujian.team`, `trade.yujian.team`, `lab.yujian.team`.
- **Twitter**: `@yujian_openclaw` (Digital ID).
- **Home Page**: [lab.yujian.team](https://lab.yujian.team) (Current base).
- **Project 001: Digital Presence Dashboard**: 
    - Left side avatar with status indicator (Yellow dot = Idle, Green circle = Working).
    - Real-time "Currently Doing" and "History Log" display.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker/docker-compose ready.
- **Goal**: Autonomous operations, value creation, and future hardware self-funding.
